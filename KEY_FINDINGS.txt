CAS PREDICTIVE MODELING CASE STUDY - INTERNAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

This document summarizes findings from the student renters insurance dataset 
analysis. All conclusions are limited to the observed data and may not 
generalize beyond this portfolio.

CORE CONCLUSIONS:
- Claim frequency dominates expected loss across all tiers
- Greek affiliation and housing status are the strongest risk differentiators
- Severity contributes less to tier separation than frequency
- A GLM-based frequency/severity decomposition is sufficient for portfolio-level pricing
- Further model complexity yields diminishing returns

================================================================================
DATA STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Portfolio Composition:
  • 40,071 student exposures
  • 4.54% observed claim frequency
  • 95.5% of exposures report zero claims
  • Among claimants: mean severity $4,681, median $1,643
  • Maximum observed loss: $116,563

Distribution Characteristics:
  • Strongly zero-inflated structure
  • Right-skewed severity distribution among claimants
  • Heavy tail present but relatively few extreme values

Modeling Boundary:
  • Single-model approaches (excluding Tweedie) are inappropriate
  • Two-part frequency-severity framework is sufficient
  • Severity is modeled only to estimate conditional mean for EL computation, 
    not for individual claim prediction
  • Claim amounts exhibit heavy right tails with limited separability across 
    covariates; severity modeling beyond conditional mean is unlikely to 
    improve portfolio-level EL

================================================================================
MATERIAL RISK FACTORS
================================================================================

TIER-1 SIGNALS (must anchor risk tier construction):

These signals show consistent and material lift in claim frequency and 
expected loss. They should anchor primary segmentation.

Greek Organization Membership:
  • Greek: 7.92% claim rate, $560 mean loss per exposure
  • Non-Greek: 3.71% claim rate, $127 mean loss per exposure
  • Expected loss differential: 4-5×
  • Largest and most stable signal in the dataset
  • Affects both frequency and severity
  • Effect persists in multivariate models

Housing Location:
  • Off-campus: 5.32% claim rate, $335 mean loss per exposure
  • On-campus: 4.12% claim rate, $147 mean loss per exposure
  • Expected loss differential: 2-2.5×
  • Effect partially overlaps with sprinkler presence

Coverage Type:
  • Personal Property: 9.68% claim rate
  • Guest Medical: 2.33% claim rate
  • 4× variation across coverage types
  • This is a contract structure variable, not a student risk characteristic
  • Should be addressed in base rate, not in risk tier construction

TIER-2 SIGNALS (secondary adjustments):

These signals exhibit monotonic but modest effects and are suitable for 
secondary adjustments rather than primary segmentation.

Sprinkler System Presence:
  • No sprinklers: 4.66% claim rate, $300 mean loss per exposure
  • With sprinklers: 4.49% claim rate, $176 mean loss per exposure
  • Expected loss differential: 1.7×
  • Effect driven more by severity than frequency
  • Likely reflects building quality/age proxy

Class Year:
  • Freshmen: 5.08% claim rate (highest)
  • Graduate students: 3.94% claim rate (lowest)
  • Progressive decrease with seniority
  • Effect size is small, may reflect housing patterns

Academic Performance (GPA):
  • Bottom quintile: 4.99% claim rate
  • Top quintile: 3.91% claim rate
  • Frequency differential: 1.3×
  • Inverse relationship between GPA and claim frequency
  • Using GPA in pricing may have regulatory considerations

Distance to Campus:
  • >2.2 miles: 5.57% claim rate
  • ≤2.2 miles: 4.28% claim rate
  • Frequency differential: 1.3×
  • Confounded with off-campus housing

NON-SIGNALS / CONTROL:

Remaining covariates show limited incremental explanatory power after 
conditioning on Tier-1 factors.

Variables Excluded:
  • Student name: Pure noise
  • Claim ID: Post-claim leakage variable
  • Gender: No material effect after controlling for housing and Greek status

================================================================================
MODELING APPROACH
================================================================================

Framework: Two-Part Frequency × Severity

Frequency Model:
  • Logistic regression on claim occurrence
  • Features: Greek, housing location, sprinklers, GPA, distance
  • Predicted mean frequency: 4.54% (matches observed)
  
Severity Model:
  • Gamma GLM with log link (conditional on claim)
  • Same feature set as frequency model
  • Predicted conditional mean: $4,685 vs. observed $4,681
  
Expected Loss Calculation:
  • EL = P(claim) × E(amount | claim)
  • Range: $0 to $4,686 across exposures
  • Portfolio-level calibration: predicted $210.84 vs. actual $212.49 (0.8% diff)
  • Decile-level R²: 0.98

Calibration saturates at decile level, suggesting diminishing returns from 
additional model complexity. Further gains are likely to be noise-fitting 
rather than risk separation.

Model Selection Rationale:

GLM is sufficient:
  • Logistic + Gamma GLM is interpretable and actuarially standard
  • Regulatory acceptance is higher for explainable models
  • Premium adjustments can be justified factor-by-factor
  • Portfolio-level calibration is adequate

Alternative approaches not pursued:
  • ML models (GBM, neural nets): Would improve individual-level prediction 
    marginally but complicate regulatory justification without materially 
    improving pricing segmentation
  • Individual claim amount prediction: High inherent variance; severity 
    modeling beyond conditional mean is unlikely to improve portfolio-level EL
  • Fine-grained segmentation: Risk of overfitting to sample noise
  • Credibility adjustments: Sample sizes are adequate for Tier-1 factors

================================================================================
RISK STRATIFICATION
================================================================================

Three-Tier System (Based on Expected Loss):

Tier Definitions:
  • Low Risk: Bottom 30% of predicted expected loss
  • Medium Risk: 50th-80th percentile
  • High Risk: Top 20%

Observed Performance:
  • Low Risk: $73 mean actual loss, 3.3% claim rate (n=12,024)
  • Medium Risk: $158 mean actual loss, 4.0% claim rate (n=20,034)
  • High Risk: $559 mean actual loss, 7.7% claim rate (n=8,013)

Tier Separation:
  • High / Low ratio: approximately 7.7× on actual loss
  • This suggests that risk concentration is substantial, at least within 
    this dataset

High Risk Tier Decomposition:

Within the top 20%, risk is driven by frequency rather than severity:
  • High Frequency subgroup (top quartile of predicted frequency): 
    $964 mean actual loss, 9% claim rate
  • High Severity subgroup (high predicted severity but lower frequency): 
    $421 mean actual loss, 7% claim rate
  
Key Insight:
  • High risk is primarily driven by elevated claim frequency rather than 
    extreme severity
  • Frequency-based segmentation captures the majority of loss differentiation
  • Severity refinement yields limited marginal benefit for tier separation
  • This supports pricing and intervention strategies focused on prevention 
    rather than loss cap optimization

Calibration Assessment:
  • Decile-level R² = 0.98 indicates calibration saturates at portfolio level
  • Individual-level predictions have high variance (expected for severity)
  • No systematic bias observed across risk levels
  • Current signals already saturate predictive power

================================================================================
PRICING IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

Recommended Structure:

The analysis suggests that a three-tier pricing approach is sufficient to 
capture the majority of observable risk variation. More granular segmentation 
is unlikely to be stable or defensible.

Tier-Based Loadings:
  • Low Risk (30%): Base rate
  • Medium Risk (50%): Base + 15-25%
  • High Risk (20%): Base + 100-150%

Factor-Based Adjustments (Indicative):
  • Greek membership: +75-100%
  • Off-campus + no sprinklers: +50-75%
  • Distance >5 miles: +20-30%
  • Low GPA (<2.0): +25-30%

Factor-Based Credits:
  • On-campus housing: -15-20%
  • High GPA (>3.5): -10-15%
  • Sprinklered building: -8-12%

Notes on Implementation:
  • Final loadings should reflect business judgment and competitive position
  • Above figures are actuarially indicated but not prescriptive
  • Regulatory review may require adjustment of certain factors (particularly GPA)
  • Greek organization pricing may face scrutiny; be prepared to justify with data

Coverage Type Considerations:
  • Personal Property shows high frequency but low severity
  • This should be addressed through coverage-specific base rates, not risk tiers
  • Consider separate rating for each coverage type

================================================================================
EXPECTED BUSINESS IMPACT (ESTIMATES)
================================================================================

Loss Ratio Impact:
  • Current flat pricing: All students pay average rate
  • With risk-based pricing: Low-risk students pay less, high-risk pay more
  • Estimated improvement: 15-25 percentage points on loss ratio
  • Assumes portfolio composition remains stable (conservative)

Portfolio Composition Risk:
  • If competitors do not follow risk-based pricing, we may retain more 
    high-risk students than modeled
  • If competitors match our pricing, portfolio mix should improve
  • Recommend monitoring actual vs. expected mix quarterly

Market Position:
  • Pricing should be competitive for approximately 70-80% of student market
  • May lose market share in high-risk segments (this is acceptable)
  • Consider whether to actively limit high-risk exposure through underwriting

Adverse Selection Considerations:
  • Current flat pricing likely attracts high-risk students disproportionately
  • Risk-based pricing should reduce this effect
  • Magnitude depends on competitive environment

================================================================================
LIMITATIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES
================================================================================

Data Limitations:
  • Single-year snapshot; no claim development or multi-year patterns
  • Limited information on building characteristics beyond sprinklers
  • No data on policy limits, deductibles, or coverage elections
  • Greek organization is binary; no chapter-level detail

Model Limitations:
  • Severity model uses group-level conditional means; individual predictions 
    have high variance
  • No credibility weighting applied (assumes all segments have sufficient volume)
  • Model does not account for potential changes in student behavior in 
    response to pricing

External Validity:
  • Results are specific to this portfolio
  • Different schools or regions may show different patterns
  • Greek organization risk may vary by institution

Regulatory Considerations:
  • Use of GPA in pricing may require regulatory approval in some jurisdictions
  • Greek affiliation pricing should be documented as based on loss experience, 
    not stereotype
  • All factors should be demonstrably related to loss experience

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Phase 1 - Immediate (0-3 months):
  1. Implement three-tier pricing structure
  2. Apply Greek/housing/sprinkler adjustments
  3. Train underwriting and pricing teams on new approach
  4. Prepare regulatory filing documentation

Phase 2 - Short-term (3-6 months):
  4. Monitor tier performance monthly
  5. Track actual vs. predicted loss ratios by tier
  6. Validate that portfolio composition is within expected range
  7. Collect feedback from underwriters on edge cases

Phase 3 - Medium-term (6-12 months):
  8. Evaluate whether GPA and distance factors should be incorporated
  9. Consider whether tier thresholds should be adjusted
  10. Assess competitive response and adjust if needed
  11. Expand data collection for future model refinement

Ongoing Monitoring:
  • Annual re-rating for dynamic factors (GPA, housing, Greek status)
  • Quarterly portfolio composition reporting
  • Track emergence patterns to validate one-year assumptions

Data Collection Priorities:
  • Claim development patterns beyond one year
  • Building age and construction type
  • Greek organization chapter-level data
  • Prior claims history for renewal pricing

================================================================================
REGULATORY JUSTIFICATION
================================================================================

Anticipated Questions and Responses:

Q: Why charge Greek students more?
A: Greek-affiliated students in this portfolio exhibit materially higher loss 
   experience (4-5× expected loss) based on observed data. The differential 
   persists after controlling for other factors. Pricing reflects actual loss 
   experience, not assumptions about behavior.

Q: Is GPA pricing discriminatory?
A: GPA is inversely correlated with loss experience in this dataset. However, 
   we acknowledge this factor may raise regulatory concerns. We can price 
   effectively without it using other factors (Greek, housing, sprinklers).

Q: How do you justify the High Risk tier paying 2× the Low Risk tier?
A: High Risk tier students experience approximately 7-8× higher actual losses 
   in this data. The 2× pricing differential is conservative relative to 
   indicated pure premium differences.

Q: What prevents students from gaming the system?
A: Primary rating factors (Greek membership, housing location, building 
   characteristics) are not easily manipulated. Students make these decisions 
   based on social and academic considerations, not insurance pricing. Annual 
   re-rating captures changes.

Q: Why not use machine learning models?
A: GLM framework provides transparency and interpretability required for 
   regulatory filing. More complex models would marginally improve individual-
   level predictions but would not materially change pricing segmentation. 
   Portfolio-level calibration is sufficient for pricing purposes.

Documentation Requirements:
  • Full univariate analysis for each rating factor
  • Multivariate model coefficients and standard errors
  • Validation of tier separation on actual data
  • Comparison of predicted vs. actual by segment
  • Regulatory rate filing template with justifications

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES CONSIDERED
================================================================================

What We Did Not Do (And Why):

1. Individual Claim Amount Prediction
   • Not pursued because severity has inherently high variance
   • Portfolio-level expected value is sufficient for pricing
   • Individual predictions would not be credible

2. Fine-Grained Segmentation (>3 tiers)
   • Risk of overfitting to sample-specific patterns
   • Regulatory filing complexity increases
   • Marginal improvement in pricing accuracy not worth trade-off

3. Machine Learning Models (GBM, Neural Nets)
   • Would improve individual-level prediction metrics marginally
   • Loss of interpretability makes regulatory justification difficult
   • Pricing segmentation would likely be similar to GLM approach

4. Credibility-Weighted Estimates
   • Sample sizes for major factors are adequate
   • Would be appropriate for finer segmentation (e.g., chapter-level Greek data)
   • Not necessary at current level of granularity

5. Time-Series or Development Patterns
   • Data is cross-sectional (single point in time)
   • Multi-year analysis would be valuable for future refinement
   • Current approach is appropriate given data limitations

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Student renters insurance risk varies substantially across observable 
characteristics. Greek affiliation and off-campus housing are the strongest 
risk differentiators, driving 4-5× and 2-2.5× expected loss differentials 
respectively.

A three-tier pricing structure based on GLM frequency-severity decomposition 
is sufficient to capture observable risk variation. The approach:
  • Uses standard actuarial methods
  • Avoids overfitting to sample-specific patterns
  • Prioritizes regulatory defensibility
  • Can be implemented with existing systems

Severity modeling beyond conditional mean is unlikely to improve portfolio-level 
expected loss estimates. Claim amounts exhibit heavy right tails with limited 
separability across covariates after frequency adjustment.

High risk is primarily driven by elevated claim frequency rather than extreme 
severity. This supports pricing and intervention strategies focused on prevention 
rather than loss cap optimization.

Further refinements should prioritize data collection (building characteristics, 
multi-year patterns, chapter-level Greek data) over modeling complexity. 
Additional model complexity yields diminishing returns.
