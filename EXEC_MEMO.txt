EXECUTIVE MEMO - STUDENT RENTERS INSURANCE PRICING ANALYSIS
================================================================================

RECOMMENDATION: Three-tier risk-based pricing structure

DATA: 40,071 exposures | 4.54% claim frequency | $212 mean loss per exposure

================================================================================

FINDING

The loss distribution is zero-inflated and frequency-driven. Risk segmentation 
is largely explained by a small set of structural covariates. Decile-level 
calibration indicates that current signals already saturate predictive power. 
Further model complexity is unlikely to materially improve pricing outcomes.

Risk concentration is substantial: the top 20% of students by predicted risk 
account for approximately 8× the loss of the bottom 30%. This differential 
exceeds current pricing structure.

================================================================================

MATERIAL RISK FACTORS

TIER-1 SIGNALS (must anchor pricing):
  • Greek affiliation: 4-5× expected loss differential vs. non-Greek
  • Off-campus housing: 2-2.5× differential vs. on-campus
  • Coverage type: 4× variation (contract structure, not risk characteristic)

TIER-2 SIGNALS (secondary adjustments):
  • Class year: monotonic but modest effect (5.08% → 3.94% freshman to grad)
  • GPA: inverse relationship, 1.3× frequency differential
  • Distance to campus: 1.3× differential, confounded with housing location

Remaining covariates show limited incremental explanatory power after 
conditioning on Tier-1 factors.

================================================================================

PROPOSED PRICING STRUCTURE

Three-Tier System (validated against actual loss data):

  Low Risk (30%): Base rate
    Observed: $73 mean loss, 3.3% claim rate

  Medium Risk (50%): Base + 15-25%
    Observed: $158 mean loss, 4.0% claim rate

  High Risk (20%): Base + 100-150%
    Observed: $559 mean loss, 7.7% claim rate

Factor-specific adjustments:
  • Greek affiliation: +75-100%
  • Off-campus without sprinklers: +50-75%
  • On-campus housing: -15-20%
  • Sprinklered building: -8-12%

Final loadings reflect competitive positioning and regulatory constraints.

================================================================================

EXPECTED IMPACT

Loss Ratio: 15-25 percentage point improvement under stable mix assumptions

Portfolio Composition:
  • Retain 70-80% of current market (low/medium risk students)
  • Attrition expected in high-risk segments (acceptable by design)
  • Quarterly monitoring of actual vs. expected mix required

Market Position:
  • Competitive pricing for majority of student market
  • Adequate pricing for high-risk exposures
  • Consider active underwriting limits for top-decile risks

================================================================================

METHODOLOGY

Frequency Model: Logistic regression (claim occurrence probability)
Severity Model: Conditional mean by segment (not individual prediction)
Expected Loss: P(claim) × E(amount | claim) for each student

Model Validation:
  • Predicted portfolio mean: $210.84 vs. actual $212.49 (0.8% difference)
  • Decile-level R²: 0.98
  • Calibration saturates at decile level

Rationale for GLM:
  • Interpretable: coefficient-level regulatory justification
  • Defensible: standard actuarial practice
  • Sufficient: captures observable risk variation
  • Implementable: existing systems and workflows

Additional model complexity yields diminishing returns. Further gains are 
likely to be noise-fitting rather than risk separation.

================================================================================

KEY INSIGHTS

1. High risk is primarily driven by elevated claim frequency rather than 
   extreme severity.

2. Frequency-based segmentation captures the majority of loss differentiation.

3. Severity refinement yields limited marginal benefit for tier separation.

4. This supports pricing and intervention strategies focused on prevention 
   rather than loss cap optimization.

================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION

Phase 1 (0-3 months): Deploy three-tier structure, file regulatory
Phase 2 (3-6 months): Monitor tier performance, validate mix assumptions  
Phase 3 (6-12 months): Evaluate Tier-2 factors, refine if material

Ongoing: Annual re-rating, quarterly portfolio monitoring

================================================================================

RISKS

Regulatory: Greek/GPA factors may face scrutiny
  → All factors justified by observed loss data; documentation prepared

Competitive: Competitors may underprice high-risk segments
  → Our pricing reflects actual risk; focus on retaining low/medium tiers

Gaming: Students manipulate risk factors
  → Key factors are multi-year commitments; limited gaming opportunity

================================================================================

LIMITATIONS

Data: Single-year cross-section; limited building detail
Model: Severity predictions have high individual variance (expected)
Scope: Results specific to this portfolio

These limitations do not preclude implementation but bound expectations.

================================================================================

CONCLUSION

Risk variation across observable characteristics is sufficient to justify 
moving from flat to risk-based pricing. The three-tier structure balances 
actuarial accuracy with regulatory and operational constraints.

Severity modeling beyond conditional mean is unlikely to improve portfolio-level 
expected loss estimates. Claim amounts exhibit heavy right tails with limited 
separability across covariates after frequency adjustment.

Further refinements should prioritize data collection over modeling complexity.
